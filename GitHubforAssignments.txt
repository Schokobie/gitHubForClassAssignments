For the practice I used VSCode because I prefer the interface. But unfortunately, I had difficulties in synchronizing my files from VSCode to Github. 
Therefore, I just use Github to submit the assignment. I posted my issue on the discussion board and hopefully, someone will be able to assist me. 
I would still prefer to integrate VSCode in my use.
